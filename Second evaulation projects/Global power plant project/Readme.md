### Global Power Plant ML project 
The Global Power Plant Database is a comprehensive, open source database of power plants around the world. It centralizes power plant data to make it easier to navigate, compare and draw insights for one’s own analysis. The database covers approximately 35,000 power plants from 167 countries and includes thermal plants (e.g. coal, gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, waste, geothermal) and renewables (e.g. hydro, wind, solar). Each power plant is geolocated and entries contain information on plant capacity, generation, ownership, and fuel type. It will be continuously updated as data becomes available.

This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and predict power plant performance on a global scale, with a specific focus on power plants in India. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to gain insights into power plant operations, optimize efficiency, and support decision-making processes for Indian power plants.

### Project Overview
The project's objectives for power plants in India are as follows:

Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data on power plants in India, including parameters such as location, capacity, fuel type, and operational performance metrics. Utilize reliable sources such as Indian government databases, energy reports, or research institutions.

Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and preprocess the collected data to ensure its quality and consistency. Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies specific to Indian power plant data. Perform feature engineering and prepare the data for machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis specific to Indian power plant data. Visualize data, identify trends, and gain insights into the factors influencing power plant performance in India.

Model Development: Build machine learning models to predict power plant performance metrics for Indian power plants, such as energy output, efficiency, emissions, and maintenance requirements. Utilize regression, classification, and clustering algorithms suitable for Indian power plant data.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed models for Indian power plants using appropriate evaluation metrics. Perform cross-validation and fine-tuning to optimize model parameters and improve predictions specific to the Indian context.
